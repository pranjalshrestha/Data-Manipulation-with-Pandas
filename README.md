2. **Total Goals (Q2)**: Print the total number of goals from the dataset.  
3. **Goals by Team (Q3)**: Print the total goals scored by each team.
4. **Drop Missing Data (Q4)**: Create Q4 by dropping rows with missing data and print the total goals again.
5. **Remove Duplicates (Q5)**: Create Q5 by removing duplicate rows and print the total goals.
6. **Statistical Summary (Q6)**: Print the statistical summary of Q5 including count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, and max for each column.
7. **Indexes for Bethany England (Q7)**: Find and print the indexes for all rows containing the player Bethany England in Q5.
8. **Significance of Remaining Rows (Q8)**: Explain the significance of the remaining rows for Bethany England after removing duplicates.
9. **Index by Player (Q9)**: Create Q9 with the Player column as the index and print it.
10. **Data for Megan Finnigan (Q10)**: Print the data for Megan Finnigan from Q9.
11. **Goals for Rachel Daly (Q11)**: Print the goals for Rachel Daly from Q9.
12. **Add Discipline Column (Q12)**: Add a Discipline column to Q9 where Discipline = (4 * Red) + (1 * Yellow).
13. **Select Columns (Q13)**: Create Q13 as a slice of Q9 containing only Player, Team, and Discipline columns.
14. **Sort Q13 (Q14)**: Create Q14, sorted by Discipline (highest to lowest) and Player (alphabetically).
15. **Sum of Discipline by Team (Q15)**: Show the sum of the Discipline column for each team.
16. **Players with Discipline Issues (Q16)**: Create Q16 with players having Discipline > 0, sorted by Team (alphabetically) and Discipline (highest to lowest).
17. **Create Q17 (Q17)**: Create Q17 with specified data and replace missing values in Discipline.
18. **Combine Q16 and Q17 (Q18)**: Combine Q16 with Q17 to create Q19 and fix team names to proper capitalization.
19. **Print Q17 (Q19)**: Print Q17 after filling missing values in the Discipline column with the average of existing values.
20. **Fix Team Names (Q20)**: Use map and a function to capitalize each word in team names in Q19.

## Summary:

- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed WSL football data, cleaned 10% of the dataset, computed total goals, and presented team-wise statistics.
- **Player Insights**: Extracted player details and computed discipline scores.
