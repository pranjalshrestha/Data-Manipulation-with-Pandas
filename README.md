7. Find and print indexes for the player Bethany England.
8. Explain the significance of remaining rows for Bethany England.
9. Create Q9 with the Player column as the index and print it.
10. Print data for Megan Finnigan from Q9.
11. Print goals for Rachel Daly from Q9.
12. Add a Discipline column to Q9 and create Q13 with selected columns.
13. Create Q14, sorted by Discipline and Player.
14. Show sum of Discipline column for each team.
15. Create Q16 with players having Discipline > 0, sorted by Team and Discipline.
16. Create Q17 with specified data and replace missing values in Discipline.
